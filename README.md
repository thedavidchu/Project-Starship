# Project Starship

## Purpose

Create a physics engine in Python, C++, and C to model the flight of a starship.

### Learning Objectives:
- Learn to interface Python with C/C++
- Improve my coding abilities
- Learn to create grapics/ keyboard interrupts in Python

## Background

A running joke in the physics community is that everything is a spherical cow without air-resistance. Of course, a starship is no different. However, I want to chip away at the notion of 'spherical' cow-ness, since the second moment of inertia dictates how much a body 'fights' angular acceleration.

## TODO

- [ ] Create a class for the starship
